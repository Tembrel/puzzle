/**
 * A framework for describing and solving puzzles that involve moves
 * from an initial state to a solution state.
 * <p>
 * There is no separate puzzle type, because an initial puzzle state
 * instance essentially defines a puzzle: Find a sequence of states
 * starting with the initial state and ending with a solution state
 * with each element of the sequence other than first being a successor
 * of the previous element of the sequence.
